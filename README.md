# Minecraft OpenComputers - Programs & Libraries

A collection of my programs and libraries for Minecraft OpenComputers.

## Libraries

`core/Minin` - Used to build lua tables
`core/Class` - Used to create OOP style classes (uses `core/Class`)
`Config` - Used to load and save configuration objects from the filesystem (uses `core/Class`, `JSON`)
`StringBuilder` - Used to help build up strings (uses `core/Class`)
`JSON` - A clone of the `JSON` encoder/decoder by **[Jeffrey Friedl](http://regex.info/blog/lua/json)**

To install all of these libraries in one go, you can use the following command on any computer with an internet card.

`pastebin run pQmNEZj7`
